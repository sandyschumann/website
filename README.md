### Bio
I currently work as a post-doctoral research associate at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). My research examines radicalisation (across different ideologies) as well as radical political attitudes online and offline. I am also interested in identifying ways to prevent radicalisation and encourage people to intervene when they observe ethnic hate crimes.
In May 2018, I founded JDI Open, a bi-weekly seminar and peer-mentoring initiative to encourage open science practices at the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science.
